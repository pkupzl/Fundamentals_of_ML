    "**Rejection sampling** is a fundamental sampling method used to generate observed samples from a specific distribution. It is also known as \"the acceptance-rejection method\" or \"the accept-reject algorithm.\" Let $p(x)$ be the probability density function of the target distribution, and let $\\mathcal{X}_{p}$  be its support set, such that $p(x)>0$ for any $x\\in \\mathcal{X}_{p}$ and $p(x)=0$ for any $x \\notin \\mathcal{X}_{p}$. In rejection sampling, we introduce a proposal distribution $q(x)$ from which we can directly sample. The support set $\\mathcal{X}_{p}$ of $p(x)$ is included in the support set $\\mathcal{X}_{q}$ of $q(x)$, meaning that $q(x)>0$ for any $x\\in \\mathcal{X}_{p}$. Additionally, there exists a positive constant $M$ such that $p(x)\\leq Mq(x)$ for any $x\\in \\mathcal{X}_{p}$.<br> \n",

The remaining accepted samples will eventually follow the desired target distribution."
